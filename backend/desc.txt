The function organizeByContext(scheduler.schedule, sortedTasks, context, startTime, endTime) you're proposing appears to be aimed at integrating tasks of a specific context ("job" in your example) into a pre-defined schedule, while also accounting for already scheduled appointments. To address your questions and define the behavior of this function, we'll consider the following rules and logic:

When the "job" context has tasks that total less than the allocated time slot
If the total duration of "job" tasks is less than the available time slot, the function should not necessarily change the end time of the "job" context slot. Instead, it could leave the remaining time as a buffer or for a break, unless you specifically want to optimize for tight scheduling. If optimizing, then yes, it could adjust the end time to reflect the actual task durations, freeing up the schedule for other potential tasks or appointments.
When there is no "job" task in the schedule
If there are no "job" tasks to schedule within the given time frame, the function should either leave the slot as is (indicating free time) or could potentially look for tasks from other contexts to fill the gap, depending on the flexibility and priorities of your scheduling logic.
Handling conflicts with appointments
If there's an appointment within the "job" context time slot, the function should schedule "job" tasks around the appointment. This means starting the "job" tasks at the designated start time and pausing for the appointment. After the appointment, it should resume the "job" tasks until either they are completed or the end time is reached. If the "job" tasks cannot be completed within the available time due to the appointment, the function should either:
Extend the "job" tasks beyond the original end time if the schedule allows.
Split the "job" tasks to fit before and after the appointment, if possible, and if not, consider rescheduling less critical tasks for another time.
Implementation Considerations
Start and End Time Adjustments: Adjusting the end time of a context block might be beneficial if the goal is to maximize the use of time throughout the day. However, this should be done considering the potential need for breaks or buffers between different tasks.

Conflict Resolution: In cases where appointments or other fixed-time obligations split available blocks, the algorithm should be flexible in reallocating tasks, perhaps by moving tasks to the next available slot or finding gaps within the day that match the task duration and priority.

Dynamic Scheduling: The function could also benefit from a dynamic approach, where it can reassess and reorganize tasks as new appointments are added or tasks are completed ahead of or behind schedule.

In conclusion, the exact behavior of organizeByContext depends on the scheduling goals (e.g., tight scheduling vs. flexible scheduling with buffers) and how you prefer to handle the surplus time or conflicts with appointments. It seems like the function should primarily attempt to fit "job" tasks within the allocated time, adjust for appointments, and use any remaining time efficiently, either by adjusting the context block's end time or by filling it with other productive tasks.
