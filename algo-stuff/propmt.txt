no i ment i want to fix the scedule i want imporantnt meeting to be ffixed at certain time then fill the rest of time with else 

no it false what i want is if i got the first meeting on 3pm it should be fixed on scheduledTime 3pm or 15:00 then its end time is Schedulte time +duration i want this to be bfore sorting with priority


it still wont do what i want , i want is first to put all tasks that got start_at in their right scheduledTime like if i got this     { id: 1, task: 'Meeting at 3Pm',  start_at: '15:00', duration: 30 }, it should be at : {
    "id": 1,
    "task": "Meeting at 3Pm",
    "scheduledTime": "15:00",
    "endTime": "15:30"
  }, then sort the rest by priority
. Let's modify the code to fill the gaps between scheduled tasks with additional tasks. 



make search algo for filling gaps

search for gaps and fill them with tasks like if there is free time between each endtime and the next scheduletetime fill them
